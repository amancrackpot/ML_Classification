# Problem Statement:
We would like to predict the probability that a person X will buy a product Y. There are a bunch of largely demographic related features available about person X. There are also features available around Xâ€™s past activities. We also have aggregated data about people who typically buy product Y available as features (their demographics and past activities). We however do not know which features are which with certainty. The variable C tells us if the person X actually bought the product Y
